Editing Task Force
=================

These are specifications and explainers related to the work of the Editing Task Force. 

**Actively developed specs:**

* See the [Editing Taskforce Charter](CHARTER.md)

* See the [Selection API](https://w3c.github.io/selection-api/) specification, which defines the `Selection` interface, the `getSelection()` method, and the `selectstart` and `selectionchange` events.


**These specs are incomplete and it is not expected that they will advance beyond draft status:**

* [Content Editable True](http://w3c.github.io/editing/contentEditableTrue.html)

* [execCommand](http://w3c.github.io/editing/execCommand.html)
